# Buildpacks used by Application Service Adapter

Application Service Adapter uses different buildpacks than TAS for VMs, which you need to know
when moving applications between the two platforms. This topic describes the
differences between the two buildpack systems.

## <a id="overview"></a>Differences between the buildpack systems

Application platforms such as TAS for VMs and Tanzu Application Platform use buildpacks to transform application source code and other assets into a self-contained artifact, such as a Cloud Foundry droplet or an Open Container Initiative container image. The platform then deploys this artifact to run instances of the application.

TAS for VMs uses Cloud Foundry buildpacks and provides a collection of system buildpacks that process many common languages and frameworks for cloud-native web applications. For more information about Cloud Foundry buildpacks, see [How Buildpacks Work](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/understand-buildpacks.html) in the TAS for VMs documentation.

Tanzu Application Platform instead uses Tanzu Buildpacks, which implement the later Cloud Native Buildpack specification to process application source code. For more information about Cloud Native Buildpacks, see the [Cloud Native Buildpacks project website](https://buildpacks.io/).

An installation of Tanzu Application Platform provides a default collection of Tanzu Buildpacks, and Application Service Adapter uses this same set of Tanzu Buildpacks to stage Cloud Foundry applications. Although this collection of Tanzu Buildpacks processes many of the same application languages and frameworks that the TAS for VMs system buildpacks do, there are some differences in the set of languages it can process, as well as differences in how certain buildpacks detect application code or accept configuration parameters.


## <a id="comparison"></a>System buildpack comparison

TAS for VMs provides the following system buildpacks for Linux-based applications:

- [Binary buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/binary/index.html)
- [Go buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/go/index.html)
- [Java buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/java/index.html)
- [.NET Core buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/dotnet-core/index.html)
- [NGINX buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/nginx/index.html)
- [Node.js buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/node/index.html)
- [PHP buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/php/index.html)
- [Python buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/python/index.html)
- [R buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/r/index.html)
- [Ruby buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/ruby/index.html)
- [Staticfile buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/staticfile/index.html)

For many applications using these buildpacks on TAS for VMs, the suite of Tanzu Buildpacks contains a cloud-native buildpack that can process its language, frameworks, and build configuration. Tanzu Buildpacks are not currently available for R applications, although community-based solutions might be available.

### <a id="binary"></a> Binary buildpack

Applications that use the [binary buildpack](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/buildpacks/binary/index.html) in TAS for VMs should use the [Tanzu Procfile Buildpack](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-procfile-procfile-buildpack.html) with Application Service Adapter. Applications must include a Procfile that defines the process types and their start commands if they do not already.
