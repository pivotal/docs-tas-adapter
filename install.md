# Installing Application Service Adapter

You can install and configure Application Service Adapter for VMware Tanzu
Application Platform by following the steps on this page.

After you complete the steps in [Installing Prerequisites](install-prerequisites.md), set the Kubernetes context to the cluster where you installed kpack and Contour.

## <a id="install-package-repo"></a>Install the package repository

To install Application Service Adapter:

1. Set up environment variables for the installation:

    ```bash
    export TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    ```

    Where `VERSION-NUMBER` is the version of Application Service Adapter you want to install. For example, `1.0.0`.

1. Verify that the `tap-install` namespace exists in your cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get ns tap-install
    ```

    The output lists the status of the `tap-install` namespace:
    ```bash
    NAME          STATUS   AGE
    tap-install   Active   2d
    ```

2. Create a registry secret to store your VMware Tanzu Network credentials in the `tap-install` namespace. These are required so that the Kubernetes cluster can pull images for the Application Service Adapter system from the VMware Tanzu Network registry.

    ```bash
    tanzu secret registry add tanzunet-tas-adapter-registry \
      --username "TANZU-NET-USERNAME" \
      --password "TANZU-NET-PASSWORD" \
      --server registry.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --export-to-all-namespaces \
      --yes \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

   Where:

   - `TANZU-NET-USERNAME` is your user name on VMware Tanzu Network.
   - `TANZU-NET-PASSWORD` the password for your user name on VMware Tanzu Network.

3. Add the Application Service Adapter package repository to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package repository add tas-adapter-repository \
      --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/app-service-adapter/tas-adapter-package-repo:${TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION} \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

4. Verify that the package repository contains the Application Service Adapter package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available list \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

   The output includes the Application Service Adapter package:

    ```bash
    NAME                                          DISPLAY-NAME                 SHORT-DESCRIPTION                                                   LATEST-VERSION
    ...
    application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com  Application Service Adapter  Application Service Adapter for VMware TanzuÂ® Application Platform  1.0.0
    ...
    ```

5. List the installation settings for the `application-service-adapter` package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available get application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com/${TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION} --values-schema --namespace tap-install
    ```

   It should output a list of settings similar to:

    ```

    ```

## <a id="configure-installation-settings"></a>Configure the installation settings

To configure the installation settings:

1. If you do not already have a secret containing a certificate and private key pair for HTTPS ingress to the Application Service Adapter API:
   * If you have a certificate and private key pair, create a secret containing them:

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl create secret tls API-TLS-SECRET-NAME \
        --cert=tls.crt \
        --key=tls.key \
        --namespace API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
     ```

   * If you do not have a certificate and private key pair, you can [use cert-manager to generate a secret containing a self-signed certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources) in the cert-manager documentation:

      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
      ---
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
      kind: Issuer
      metadata:
        name: selfsigned-issuer
        namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      spec:
        selfSigned: {}
      ---
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
      kind: Certificate
      metadata:
        name: api-selfsigned-certificate
        namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      spec:
        commonName: API-FQDN
        dnsNames:
          - API-FQDN
        issuerRef:
          name: selfsigned-issuer
        privateKey:
          algorithm: RSA
        secretName: API-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        usages:
        - server auth
        - client auth
      EOF
      ```

2. If you do not already have a secret containing a wildcard certificate and private key pair for HTTPS application ingress:
   * If you have a wildcard certificate and private key pair, create a secret containing them:

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl create secret tls APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME \
        --cert=tls.crt \
        --key=tls.key \
        --namespace APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
     ```

   * If you do not have a wildcard certificate and private key pair, you can [use cert-manager to generate a Secret containing a self-signed wildcard certificate](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources) in the cert-manager documentation:

      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
      ---
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
      kind: Issuer
      metadata:
        name: selfsigned-issuer
        namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      spec:
        selfSigned: {}
      ---
      apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
      kind: Certificate
      metadata:
        name: app-domain-selfsigned-certificate
        namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      spec:
        commonName: *.DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN
        dnsNames:
          - *.DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN
        issuerRef:
          name: selfsigned-issuer
        privateKey:
          algorithm: RSA
        secretName: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        usages:
        - server auth
        - client auth
      EOF
      ```

3. If you do not already have a secret containing the host name, user name, and password for your application image registry, create one:

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    kubectl create secret docker-registry APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME \
      --docker-server=APP-REGISTRY-SERVER \
      --docker-username=APP-REGISTRY-USERNAME \
      --docker-password=$(cat /path/to/APP-REGISTRY-PASSWORD) \
      --namespace APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    ```

   Where:

   - `APP-REGISTRY-SERVER` is the address of the registry used for app packages and droplets. This value is the same as the server name in a `dockerconfigjson` Kubernetes secret. For example:
     - Harbor has the form `my-harbor.io`.
     - Docker Hub the form `https://index.docker.io/v1/`.
     - Google Container Registry has the form `gcr.io`.

4. Create a `SecretExport` to allow Application Service Adapter to copy the application image registry credentials secret into the `cf` namespace.

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   ---
   apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: SecretExport
   metadata:
     name: APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME
     namespace: APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
   spec:
     toNamespace: cf
   EOF
   ```

5. Create a `tas-adapter-values.yaml` file with the installation settings that you want, following the schema specified for the package.

   The following values are required:

    ```yaml
    ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to the boolean value true. Not a string.
    api_ingress:
      fqdn: "API-FQDN"
      tls:
        secret_name: API-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    app_ingress:
      default_domain: "DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN"
      tls:
        secret_name: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    app_registry:
      credentials:
        secret_name: "APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME"
        namespace: "APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE"
      hostname: "APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME"
      path:
        droplets: "APP-REGISTRY-PATH-DROPLETS"
        packages: "APP-REGISTRY-PATH-PACKAGES"
    ```

   Where:

   - `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that you want to use for the Application Service Adapter API. Example: `api.example.com`
   - `API-TLS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the PEM-encoded public certificate for the Application Service Adapter API.
   - `API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the API TLS secret.
   - `DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN` is the domain that you want to use for automatically configured application routes. Example: `apps.example.com`.
   - `APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the PEM-encoded public certificate for applications deployed using the Application Service Adapter.
   - `APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the application TLS secret.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` secret containing the host, user name, and password for the application image registry.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the application image registry secret.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME` is the host name of the registry used for app packages and droplets. For example:
     - Harbor has the form `hostname: "my-harbor.io"`
     - Docker Hub has the form `hostname: "index.docker.io"`
     - Google Container Registry has the form `hostname: "gcr.io"`
   - `APP-REGISTRY-PATH-DROPLETS` is the path to the directory or project in the app registry where Application Service Adapter uploads droplets, such as runnable application images. This value does not include the registry host name itself. Examples:
     - Harbor has the form `droplets: "project-name/my-repo-name"`
     - Docker Hub has the form `droplets: "my-dockerhub-username"`
     - Google Container Registry has the form `droplets: "project-id/my-repo-name"`
   - `APP-REGISTRY-PATH-PACKAGES` is the is the path to the directory or project in the app registry where Application Service Adapter uploads packages, such as application source code. This value does not include the registry host name itself. Examples:
     - Harbor has the form `packages: "project-name/my-repo-name"`
     - Docker Hub has the form `packages: "my-dockerhub-username"`
     - Google Container Registry has the form `packages: "project-id/my-repo-name"`

   The following values are optional but recommended:

    ```yaml
    admin:
      users:
      - "ADMIN-USERNAME"
      ...
    ```

   Where:

   - `ADMIN-USERNAME` is the name of an existing user in the Kubernetes cluster to whom to grant system admin privileges. You can specify as many users as you want, one per line. These names are identifiers for Kubernetes user accounts, not Kubernetes service accounts.
     - For Amazon EKS, see the [AWS IAM user management for EKS section](user-management.md#aws-iam-user-management-eks) of the User Management topic for information on additional required cluster configuration to map AWS IAM users and roles to Kubernetes roles.
     - For clusters configured to use authentication proxies such as [Pinniped](https://pinniped.dev/), you can authenticate to the cluster and use the output of `cf curl /whoami` to see the user account name to provide.

   > **Note** These user names are the ones that Kubernetes recognizes as user identifiers in the subject section of its RBAC resources, such as `RoleBindings`, and may differ from the names of the user entries in your local Kubeconfig file. If you are not certain of this user name, you can leave this entry empty for the initial installation. After completing the installation and logging in with the cf CLI, use the `cf curl /whoami` command to confirm the user name and then update the installation with the correct name value. For more information about user subject names in Kubernetes, see the [Referring to subjects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#referring-to-subjects) section of _Using RBAC Authorization_ and the [Authenticating](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/) topic in the Kubernetes project documentation.

   See additional optional values in the following example. For more information on optional values, see the Tanzu CLI output.

    telemetry:
      heartbeat_interval: TELEMETRY-HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL
    user_certificate_expiration_warning_duration: "USER-CERT-EXPIRY-WARNING-DURATION"
    ```

   Where:

   - `API-AUTH-PROXY-TLS-CRT` is the CA certificate from the authentication proxy running along side your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `API-AUTH-PROXY-FQDN` is the FQDN for the authentication proxy running along side your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `API-PORT` is the port number which clients should use to connect to the Application Service Adapter API, and which the API will include in URLs that direct back to itself. When set to `0` or left unset, no port is included in those URLs, and clients should connect to port 443, the standard port for HTTPS traffic.
   - `PEM-ENCODED-CERTIFICATE-CONTENTS` is a PEM encoded multiline string containing the certificate authority (CA) certificate.
       - The value must be inserted into your values file as a YAML multiline string with a block scalar literal.
   - `KPACK-CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the kpack cluster builder to
     use for staging. Tanzu Build Service provides two cluster builders named
     `base` and `default`. To create your own builder, see [Managing
     Builders](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Build-Service/1.3/vmware-tanzu-build-service/GUID-managing-builders.html)
     in the Tanzu Build Service documentation, and update this setting with the
     corresponding builder name.
   - `USER-CERT-EXPIRY-WARNING-DURATION` is the recommended duration beyond which user are warned to use short-lived certificates for authentication. Default is 168 hours.
   - `API-CPU-LIMIT` is the CPU resource limit for the pods that you want in the specified deployment. Default is 1 CPU.
   - `API-MEMORY-LIMIT` is the memory resource limit that you want for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 1000Mi.
   - `API-CPU-REQUEST` is the CPU resource request that you want for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 50m.
   - `API-MEMORY-REQUEST` is the memory resource request that you want for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 100Mi.
   - `API-REPLICA-COUNT` is the number of replicas that you want for the specified deployment. Default is 1.
   - `KUBERNETES-DISTRIBUTION` is the name of the Kubernetes distribution. Defaults to "".
       - Set "openshift" as the value when installing on an OpenShift environment.
       - Leave it unset for all other distributions.
   - `TELEMETRY-HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL` is how often telemetry data is sent to VMware. Default is every 24 hours.

   The `requests` and `limits` text boxes map directly to the resource requests and limits text boxes on the Kubernetes containers for these system components.
   For more information, see [Resource requests and limits of Pod and container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) in the Kubernetes documentation.

### <a id="opt-out-telemetry"></a>Opting out of telemetry reporting

By default, when you install Application Service Adapter, you opt into telemetry collection. To deactivate telemetry collection, complete the following instructions:

1. Ensure that your Kubernetes context is pointing to the cluster where Application Service Adapter is installed.

1. Run the following kubectl command:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: vmware-system-telemetry
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    namespace: vmware-system-telemetry
    name: vmware-telemetry-cluster-ceip
  data:
    level: disabled
  EOF
  ```

Your Application Service Adapter deployment no longer emits telemetry, and you are opted out of the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program.

### <a id="custom-ca-registry"></a>(Optional) Configure a Registry With a Custom Certificate Authority

Your Kubernetes cluster nodes and the Tanzu Build Service component of Tanzu Application Platform must also both be configured to trust this Certificate Authority for the registry.

To configure Application Service Adapter to trust a registry that has a custom or self-signed certificate authority:

1. Set the value of the `app_registry_credentials.ca_cert_data` property in the `tas-adapter-values.yaml` file with the PEM encoded certificate for the registry's Certificate Authority.

### <a id="experimental-cartographer-integration"></a>(Optional) Configure the Experimental Cartographer Integration

Opting into the experimental Cartographer integration requires a larger set of Tanzu Application Platform packages to be installed. See [Required components for experimental Cartographer integration](install-prerequisites.md#required-components-cartographer) in _Install Prerequisites_.

To configure the experimental Cartographer integration:

1. Set the value of the `experimental_use_cartographer` property in the
   `tas-adapter-values.yaml file.

## <a id="install-adapter"></a>Install Application Service Adapter

To install Application Service Adapter:

1. Install Application Service Adapter to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package install tas-adapter \
      --package-name application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version "${TAS_ADAPTER_VERSION}" \
      --values-file tas-adapter-values.yaml \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Verify that the package install was successful.

    ```bash
    tanzu package installed get tas-adapter \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

   The following is an example output:

    ```bash
    | Retrieving installation details for tas-adapter...
    NAME:                    tas-adapter
    PACKAGE-NAME:            application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com
    PACKAGE-VERSION:         1.0.0
    STATUS:                  Reconcile succeeded
    CONDITIONS:              [{ReconcileSucceeded True  }]
    USEFUL-ERROR-MESSAGE:
    ```

## <a id="configure-dns"></a>Configure DNS for Application Service Adapter

To configure DNS for Application Service Adapter:

1. Determine the external IP address to use for ingress to your cluster. This step varies depending on the IaaS used to provision your cluster.

   For clusters that support LoadBalancer services, you can obtain the external IP address of the LoadBalancer Service that is associated with Contour's Envoy proxy. The Namespace for this service is typically either `tanzu-system-ingress` or `projectcontour` depending on how Contour was installed.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n tanzu-system-ingress get service envoy -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}'
    ```

   > **Note** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, your LoadBalancer has a DNS name instead of an IP address.

2. Create an A record in your DNS zone that resolves the configured API FQDN to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

   > **Note** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, create a CNAME record that resolves to the DNS name of the load balancer instead of an A record.

3. Create a wildcard A record in your DNS zone that resolves all sub-domains of the configured application domain to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

4. Verify that the Contour HTTPProxy for the API endpoint is valid.

   ```bash
   kubectl -n tas-adapter-system get httpproxy korifi-api-proxy
   ```

   The following is an example output:

    ```bash
    NAME               FQDN       TLS SECRET                STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
    korifi-api-proxy   API-FQDN   korifi-api-ingress-cert   valid    Valid HTTPProxy
    ```

## <a id="assign-admin-user"></a>Log in with a system admin user

After you install the Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI), log in to Application Service Adapter with one of the system admin users you configured in the `admin.users` value:

1. Target the cf CLI at the API endpoint.

    ```bash
    cf api API-FQDN --skip-ssl-validation
    ```

    Where `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the Application Service Adapter API.

    > **Note** If you configured the Application Service Adapter with a globally trusted certificate during installation, you can omit the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag.

2. Log in with the cf CLI.

    ```bash
    cf login
    ```

    The cf CLI detects the user authentication entries in your local Kubeconfig file and presents them for you to select one interactively. Select an entry corresponding to one of the users you configured in the list in the `admin.users` value.

3. Use the `cf curl` command to verify the subject name of the logged-in user.

    ```bash
    cf curl /whoami
    ```

    The output looks like the following:

    ```
    {"name":"my_user@example.com","kind":"User"}
    ```

    The value of the `name` text box in the response is the subject name of the user, and matches the name configured in `admin.users`.

    The `kind` text box in the output must have the value `User`. If it is some other value, such as `ServiceAccount`, log in to the Application Service Adapter with an account for a user in the Kubernetes cluster.

   To test Application Service Adapter, continue to [Getting Started](getting-started.md).
