# Installing Application Service Adapter

This topic describes how to install the Application Service Adapter for VMware Tanzu Application Platform system:

* [Install the package repository](#install-package-repo)
* [Configure the installation settings](#configure-installation-settings)
* [Install the Application Service Adapter](#install-adapter)
* [Configure DNS for the Application Service Adapter](#configure-dns)

----

After you have completed the steps in [Installing Prerequisites](install-prerequisites.md), set the Kubernetes context to the cluster where you have installed kpack and Contour.

## <a id="install-package-repo"></a>Install the package repository

To install Application Service Adapter:

1. Create a namespace called `tas-adapter-install` for deploying Application Service Adapter to your cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl create ns tas-adapter-install
    ```

1. Create an image pull secret to store your Tanzu Network credentials. These are required so that the cluster can pull images from the Tanzu Network registry.

    ```bash
    tanzu secret registry add tanzunet-registry \
      --username "TANZU-NET-USER" --password "TANZU-NET-PASSWORD" \
      --server registry.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --export-to-all-namespaces --yes \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

   Where `TANZU-NET-USER` and `TANZU-NET-PASSWORD` are your credentials for Tanzu Network.

1. Add the Application Service Adapter package repository to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package repository add tas-adapter-repository \
      --url registry.tanzu.vmware.com/app-service-adapter/tas-adapter-package-repo:0.9.0 \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```
1. Verify that the package repository contains the Application Service Adapter package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available list \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

   The output includes the Application Service Adapter package:

    ```bash
    NAME                                          DISPLAY-NAME                 SHORT-DESCRIPTION                                                   LATEST-VERSION
    ...
    application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com  Application Service Adapter  Application Service Adapter for VMware TanzuÂ® Application Platform  0.9.0
    ...
    ```

1. List the installation settings for the `application-service-adapter` package.

    ```bash
    tanzu package available get application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com/0.9.0 --values-schema --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

   It should output a list of settings similar to:

    ```

      ...
    ```

## <a id="configure-installation-settings"></a>Configure the installation settings

To configure the installation settings:

1. If you do not already have a secret containing a certificate and private keypair for HTTPS ingress to the Application Service Adapter API:
   * If you have a certificate and private keypair, create a secret.

      ```bash
      kubectl create namespace API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl delete secret API-TLS-SECRET-NAME -n API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
      kubectl create secret tls API-TLS-SECRET-NAME --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key -n API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
     ```

   * If you do not have a certificate and private keypair, you can [generate a self-signed secret using cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources).

   * Alternatively, you can generate a self-signed certificate manually.
     * If you are using `openssl`, or `libressl v3.1.0` or later:

        ```bash
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
          -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
          -nodes -subj '/CN=API-FQDN' \
          -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:API-FQDN" \
          -days 365
        ```
        Where `API-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to use to access the API.

     * If you are using version `libressl` v3.1.0 or earlier:

        ```bash
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
          -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
          -nodes -subj '/CN=API-FQDN' \
          -extensions SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[ SAN ]\nsubjectAltName='DNS:API-FQDN'")) \
          -days 365
        ```

     * > **Note:** `libressl` v3.1.0 is the default version in macOS.

     * Create a secret.

       ```bash
       kubectl create namespace API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
       kubectl delete secret API-TLS-SECRET-NAME -n API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
       kubectl create secret tls API-TLS-SECRET-NAME --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key -n API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
       ```

   1. If you do not already have a secret containing a wildcard certificate and private keypair for HTTPS application ingress:
      * If you have a wildcard certificate and private keypair, create a secret.

         ```bash
         kubectl create namespace APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
         kubectl delete secret APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME -n APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
         kubectl create secret tls APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key -n APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
        ```

      * If you do not have a wildcard certificate and private keypair, you can [generate a self-signed secret using cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#creating-certificate-resources).

      * Alternatively, you can generate a self-signed certificate manually.
         * If you are using `openssl`, or `libressl v3.1.0` or later:

            ```bash
            openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
              -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
              -nodes -subj '/CN=*.APP-DOMAIN' \
              -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:*.APP-DOMAIN" \
              -days 365
            ```
            Where `APP-DOMAIN` is the FQDN of the shared domain to use for application routes. By default, each application is mapped to a route on a subdomain of this shared domain.

         * If you are using version `libressl` v3.1.0 or earlier:

           ```bash
           openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \
             -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt \
             -nodes -subj '/CN=*.APP-DOMAIN' \
             -extensions SAN -config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[ SAN ]\nsubjectAltName='DNS:*.APP-DOMAIN'")) \
             -days 365
           ```

         * > **Note:** The TLS certificate for application ingress must be a wildcard certificate.
         * > **Note:** `libressl` v3.1.0 is the default version in macOS.

         * Create a secret.

         ```bash
         kubectl create namespace APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
         kubectl delete secret APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME -n APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
         kubectl create secret tls APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key -n APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
         ```

2. Create a `tas-adapter-values.yml` file with the desired installation settings, following the schema specified for the package.

   The following values are required:

    ```yaml
    ---
    ceip_policy_disclosed: FALSE-OR-TRUE-VALUE # Installation fails if this is not set to true. Not a string.
    api_ingress:
      fqdn: "API-FQDN"
      tls:
        secret_name: API-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        namespace: API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    app_ingress:
      default_domain: "DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN"
      tls:
        secret_name: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME
        namespace: APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE
    app_registry:
      credentials:
        username: "APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-USERNAME"
        password: "APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-PASSWORD"
      hostname: "APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME"
      path:
        droplets: "APP-REGISTRY-PATH-DROPLETS"
        packages: "APP-REGISTRY-PATH-PACKAGES"
    ```

   Where:

   - `API-FQDN` is the FQDN that you want to use for the Application Service Adapter API.
   - `API-TLS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the PEM-encoded public certificate for the Application Service Adapter API.
   - `API-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the API TLS secret.
   - `DEFAULT-APP-DOMAIN` is the domain that you want to use for automatically configured application routes.
   - `APP-TLS-SECRET-NAME` is the `kubernetes.io/tls` secret containing the PEM-encoded public certificate for applications deployed using the Application Service Adapter.
   - `APP-TLS-SECRET-NAMESPACE` is the namespace containing the application TLS secret.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-USERNAME` is the username used to access the registry, or the reserved keyword indicating service account JSON. For example, `_json_key`.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-PASSWORD` is the password used to access the registry, or service account JSON. For example, `{\"type\": \"service_account\", \"project_id\": \"my-gcr-project-id\"...}\` for the GCP service account.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-HOSTNAME` is the hostname of the registry to be used for app packages and droplets. This value should be the same as the server name in a `dockerconfigjson` Kubernetes secret. Examples: `gcr.io`, `demo.goharbor.io`, `https://index.docker.io/v1`.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-PATH-DROPLETS` is the path to the directory or project in the app registry where Application Service Adapter uploads droplets, such as runnable application images. This value should not include the registry hostname itself. For example, `tas-adapter/droplets`.
   - `APP-REGISTRY-PATH-PACKAGES` is the is the path to the directory or project in the app registry where Application Service Adapter uploads packages, such as application source code. This value should not include the registry hostname itself. For example, `tas-adapter/packages`.

   See optional values in the following example. For more information, see the Tanzu CLI output.

    ```yaml

    ```

   Where:

   - `API-AUTH-PROXY-TLS-CRT` is the CA certificate from the authentication proxy running along side your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `API-AUTH-PROXY-FQDN` is the FQDN for the authentication proxy running along side your Kubernetes cluster.
   - `PEM-ENCODED-CERTIFICATE-CONTENTS` is a PEM encoded multiline string containing the Certificate Authority certificate
       - The value must be inserted into your values file as a yaml multiline string with a block scalar literal.
   - `KPACK-CLUSTER-BUILDER-NAME` is the name of the kpack cluster builder to use for staging. Tanzu Build Service provides two cluster builders named `base` and `default`. To create your own builder, see [Managing Builders](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Tanzu-Build-Service/1.3/vmware-tanzu-build-service-v13/GUID-managing-builders.html) in the Tanzu Build Service documentation, and update this setting with the corresponding builder name.

   - `API-CPU-LIMIT` is the desired CPU resource limit for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 1 cpu.
   - `API-MEMORY-LIMIT` is the desired memory resource limit for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 1000Mi.
   - `API-CPU-REQUEST` is the desired CPU resource request for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 50m.
   - `API-MEMORY-REQUEST` is the desired memory resource request for the pods in the specified deployment. Default is 100Mi.
   - `API-REPLICA-COUNT` is the desired number of replicas for the specified deployment. Default is 1.
   - `TELEMETRY-HEARTBEAT-INTERVAL` is how often telemetry data is sent to VMware. Default is every 24 hours.

   The `requests` and `limits` fields map directly to the resource requests and limits fields on the Kubernetes containers for these system components.
   For more information, see [Resource requests and limits of Pod and container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#resource-requests-and-limits-of-pod-and-container) in the Kubernetes documentation.


### <a id="opt-out-telemetry"></a>Opting out of telemetry reporting

By default, when you install Application Service Adapter, you opt into telemetry collection. To turn off telemetry collection, complete the following instructions:

1. Ensure your Kubernetes context is pointing to the cluster where Application Service Adapter is installed.

2. Run the following kubectl command:

  ```yaml
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: vmware-system-telemetry
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    namespace: vmware-system-telemetry
    name: vmware-telemetry-cluster-ceip
  data:
    level: disabled
  EOF
  ```

Your Application Service Adapter deployment no longer emits telemetry, and you are opted out of the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program.

### <a id="custom-ca-registry"></a>Configure a Registry With a Custom Certificate Authority

To configure the Application Service Adapter with a registry that has a custom or self-signed certificate authority:

1. Set the value of the `app_registry_credentials.ca_cert_data` property in the `tas-adapter-values.yml` file with a PEM encoded Certificate Authority certificate.

> **Note:** Your cluster nodes must trust the Certificate Authority that the Application Service Adapter is configured with. Tanzu Build Service must be configured to trust this registry Certificate Authority certificate.

## <a id="experimental-cartographer-integration"></a>Configure the Experimental Cartographer Integration

To configure the experimental Cartographer integration:

1. Ensure that you have installed the appropriate Tanzu Application Platform compoments.
   * If you have installed Tanzu Application Platform v1.1 with the `full`, `iterate`, `run`, or `light` profile, this package is installed.
   * If you have installed Tanzu Application Platform v1.1 without using a profile, see:
      * [Install Supply Chain Choreographer](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.1/tap/GUID-scc-install-scc.html)
      * [Install Source Controller](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.2/tap/GUID-source-controller-install-source-controller.html)
      * [Out of the Box Templates](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.2/tap/GUID-scc-ootb-templates.html)
      * [Tekton](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.2/tap/GUID-tekton-tekton-about.html)

1. Set the value of the `experimental_use_cartographer` property in the `tas-adapter-values.yml` file to `true`. Note that this is not a string.

## <a id="install-adapter"></a>Install the Application Service Adapter

To install the Application Service Adapter:

1. Install the Application Service Adapter to the cluster.

    ```bash
    tanzu package install tas-adapter \
      --package-name application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com \
      --version 0.9.0 \
      --values-file tas-adapter-values.yml \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

1. Verify that the package install was successful.

    ```bash
    tanzu package installed get tas-adapter \
      --namespace tas-adapter-install
    ```

   The output looks like the following:

    ```bash
    | Retrieving installation details for tas-adapter...
    NAME:                    tas-adapter
    PACKAGE-NAME:            application-service-adapter.tanzu.vmware.com
    PACKAGE-VERSION:         0.9.0
    STATUS:                  Reconcile succeeded
    CONDITIONS:              [{ReconcileSucceeded True  }]
    USEFUL-ERROR-MESSAGE:
    ```

## <a id="configure-dns"></a>Configure DNS for the Application Service Adapter

To configure DNS for the Application Service Adapter:

1. Determine the external IP address to be used for ingress to your cluster. This step varies depending on the IaaS used to provision your cluster.

   For clusters that support LoadBalancer services, you can obtain the external IP address of the LoadBalancer Service that is associated with Contour's Envoy proxy. The Namespace for this service is typically either `tanzu-system-ingress` or `projectcontour` depending on how Contour was installed.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n tanzu-system-ingress get service envoy -ojsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*].ip}'
    ```

   > **Note:** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, your LoadBalancer has a DNS name instead of an IP address.

1. Create an A record in your DNS zone that resolves the configured API FQDN to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

   > **Note:** If you are using a cluster deployed on AWS, create a CNAME record that resolves to the DNS name of the load balancer instead of an A record.

1. Create a wildcard A record in your DNS zone that resolves all sub-domains of the configured application domain to the external IP address from step 1. This step varies depending on your DNS provider.

1. Verify that the Contour HTTPProxy for the API endpoint is valid.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n korifi-api-system get httpproxy korifi-api-proxy
    ```

   The output looks like the following:
    ```bash
    NAME               FQDN       TLS SECRET                STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
    korifi-api-proxy   API-FQDN   korifi-api-ingress-cert   valid    Valid HTTPProxy
    ```

   Target the API endpoint by running `cf api API-FQDN` and start deploying applications. To test the adapter, continue to [Getting Started](getting-started.md).
