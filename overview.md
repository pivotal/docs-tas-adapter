# Application Service Adapter for VMware Tanzu Application Platform

## Overview

Application Service Adapter aims to provide compatibility with [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) client interfaces to existing users of [Tanzu Application Service for VMs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-service) while running on top of Kubernetes and integrating with the components of [Tanzu Application Platform](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-platform). Development teams using Tanzu Application Service for VMs tooling, such as the Cloud Foundry command-line interface (cf CLI) and other clients of the Cloud Foundry API (CAPI), can then maintain their familiar workflows while their platform teams transition their infrastructure and deployments to Kubernetes.

The following diagram shows a high-level architecture of Application Service Adapter with user flows:

Application Service Adapter is distributed as a [Carvel package](https://carvel.dev/) for platform teams to configure and install to a Kubernetes cluster with the Tanzu CLI tool. The key user personas of Application Service Adapter remain the same as the user personas of Tanzu Application Serivce: the platform operator and the app developer.

Platform teams create Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces in the installation, which the Application Service Adapter backs with separate Kubernetes namespaces. Application developers then use these orgs and spaces to organize their apps as they do today with Tanzu Application Service for VMs.

Application developers log in to their Application Service Adapter installation with credentials for the underlying Kubernetes cluster, but then use the cf CLI and CAPI to push apps and to map routes to them.

Application Service Adapter integrates with an existing installation of [Tanzu Build Service](https://tanzu.vmware.com/build-service) component of Tanzu Application Platform to build container images for app code deployed to the platform. It also integrates with [Contour](https://projectcontour.io/) to realize ingress routes to running apps.
