# User authentication with Application Service Adapter

On this page, learn how Application Service Adapter authenticates and authorizes
users by using the Kubernetes API server.

## <a id="background"></a> Background

Traditionally, the cf CLI authenticates with the Cloud Foundry [User Account and Authentication](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/uaa.html) (UAA) server, which acts as an OAuth2 provider. In this model, the Cloud Foundry API server validates the user's token and authorizes user actions based on its own set of user role assignments.

The Application Service Adapter takes a different approach to user authentication and authorization. Instead of requiring UAA as a separate account and authentication service, the Application Service Adapter delegates this responsibility to the [Kubernetes API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/). The cf CLI now recognizes when it targets a Kubernetes-backed CAPI server such as the Application Service Adapter, uses user information from the local kubeconfig file to authenticate with the underlying Kubernetes API, and extracts the user token or client certificate or key pair from the authentication response. When it makes a request to the CAPI server, it then sends that credential in the Authorization header. The Cloud Foundry API server uses that credential to perform requests on behalf of the end user and retains it in memory only for the duration of the user's API request.

The Application Service Adapter relies on core Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) resources such as `ClusterRole` and `RoleBinding` to configure user authorization rules. Platform operators can create these RBAC resources either using the Cloud Foundry role API endpoints or directly in the Kubernetes API.

The Application Service Adapter API requires that users connect to it using HTTPS because the Authorization header contains the userâ€™s authentication token or client certificate or key pair. The API translates the CAPI request into Kubernetes API requests using the provided credentials.

>**Note** The user is authenticated through their Kubernetes token or client certificate or key for each request to the Adapter's API. There is no persistent session data stored between requests.

VMware recommends using short-lived tokens or certificates to authenticate with the Application Service Adapter.
The Application Service Adapter warns users if their certificate is still valid in one week.
